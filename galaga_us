1) I want a game in which the player controls a spacecraft which shoots at the enemy ships that come from the top of the screen.  The player can move their spacecraft from side to side.
    - It needs a scoreboard in the corner of the screen.
    - It needs a display of the players remaining health (or lives)
    - It needs a menu page
    - It needs a Game Over screen


    - Reach Goals:
        - The ability for a player to enter their name
        - The ability to log the scores of different players
        - A high scores page
        - Add sprite animation
