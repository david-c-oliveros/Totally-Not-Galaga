- Ideas
    - Lunar Lander clone
        - 2D game where the player controls a little lunar lander to land on the moon
        - The moon is uneven with craters and peaks

        - The physics engine
            - Would require implementing a rudementary physics engine
                - Each game tick the lander's position is acted upon by multiple acceleration vectors, gravity and the acceleration from its rocket engine

        - The map
            - Would take some research to figure out how to properly render and store the map in such a way as to fascilitate creating colliders




    - Backup idea if this one proves too ambitious for a DOM implementation 
        - Battleship
